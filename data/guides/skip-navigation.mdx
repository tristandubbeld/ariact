> Verdict: This method is very effective for screen reader users, but sighted keyboard users generally cannot take advantage of it. Even so, there are many reasons to use headings, so this method is highly recommended.

### Why (and when) do you need it

## Example

### Creating the skip navigation

### Landmarks

### Hiding the skip navigation (visually)

## Browser support

On this website we use `:focus-within` to visually show the skip navigation component. If you need to support browsers like Internet Explorer you could show links on `:focus`, or handle visibility with Javascript.
