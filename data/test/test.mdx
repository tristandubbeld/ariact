title: 'This is a test page'
---

This is some test text on a test page. This is a paragraph.

# heading 1

We need to add linting rules to `mdx` files. We don't want `h1`'s in the `mdx` files, those are added in the layout through the frontmatter.

## heading 2

This is a code block

```
const a = 'b';
```

And one that should have `tsx` formatting.

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const text = 'hello world';

  return <p>{text}</p>;
};
```

### heading 3

This is interactive html:

<div>
  <button>click me!</button>
</div>

#### heading 4

##### heading 5

###### heading 6
