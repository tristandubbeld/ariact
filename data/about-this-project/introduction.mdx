The goal with Ariact is to create pages for relevant topics in the [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and add practical React related examples.
These examples can range from best practices and `eslint` to component libraries.

## Vision

Making a website or app accessible could be something you're not looking forward to.
There are a lot of guidelines, rules and `aria` attributes you might have heard about and it is hard to know how, and where to start.

There are a lot of resources that can help you, but picking the right tool for the job (especially in React-land) can be a daunting task.
Ariact aims to be a handbook explaining accessibility guidelines set by W3C, together with practical examples and a list of tools to help you.

## What to expect

Ariact (as the name implies) is mainly focussed on React. For each WCAG guideline I will try to provide a short explanation,
together with advice on how to implement the guideline yourself or a recommendeded list of libraries.

Ariact is still a work in progress, so please bear with me while content keeps being added. Please consider <a href="/about-this-project/contributing">contributing</a>!
